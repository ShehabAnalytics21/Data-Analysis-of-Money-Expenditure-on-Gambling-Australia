<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project:
*	Everyone agrees that gambling plays a significant role in the Australian culture, and both the media and popular literature have done a great deal to promote the idea that we are a "country of gamblers." Australian governments, in contrast to those of most Western countries, actively promote a wide variety of legal gaming options.
*	In this report, the gambling patterns in Australia will be studied and analysed, specifically, two main questions of interest are to be addressed in this report, the two questions are: 
    1.	How Does the Money Expenditure Change in the Different States?
    2.	What is the Relationship Between Money Expenditure and the Gambling Category?
